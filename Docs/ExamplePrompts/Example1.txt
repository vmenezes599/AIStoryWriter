Please write a story set in the Genshin Impact universe, where Alhaitham invents computers, and subsequently discovers that he is living inside of a video game.
Have him then hack the game and get an API like access to the game where he can begin to control things, and cover how this affects the story that the traveler (Aether) sees.
